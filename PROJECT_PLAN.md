# MCP Time Server Project Plan

## Project Overview
Simple MCP (Model Context Protocol) server implementation in Python that returns current UTC time. This server will be configured globally in Cursor IDE to provide time functionality across all projects.

## Goal
Implement the simplest possible MCP server that:
- Returns current UTC time
- Can be configured globally in Cursor IDE
- Works independently of any specific project
- Provides reliable time access for the AI assistant

## Objectives
1. Create a minimal MCP server in Python
2. Implement UTC time retrieval functionality
3. Ensure proper MCP protocol compliance
4. Configure for global Cursor IDE integration
5. Test functionality and reliability

## Issues and Solutions

### Identified Issues
*None yet - project just started*

### Resolved Issues
- **MCP Import Error**: Fixed by switching from direct MCP server implementation to FastMCP which provides simpler API
- **PowerShell && Operator**: Documented workaround in README for Windows PowerShell compatibility
- **Time Format Handling**: Implemented robust format handling with fallback to ISO format for invalid inputs

## Progress Log

### 2025-06-21
- [x] Project directory cleared
- [x] Project plan created
- [x] Basic project structure created
- [x] Python package configuration completed
- [x] MCP server implementation completed (using FastMCP)
- [x] Basic functionality implemented and tested
- [x] Documentation created
- [x] Test script created
- [x] All core features working
- [x] MCP server successfully running
- [x] Cursor IDE integration successful
- [x] Live testing completed - all formats working
- [x] Project completed and fully operational

## Next Steps
1. ~~Create basic project structure~~ ✅
2. ~~Setup Python package configuration~~ ✅  
3. ~~Implement basic MCP server~~ ✅
4. ~~Add UTC time functionality~~ ✅

## Project Status: COMPLETED ✅

The MCP Time Server project has been successfully completed and **FULLY OPERATIONAL**. All core functionality is implemented, tested, and integrated with Cursor IDE. The server provides UTC time in multiple formats and is working perfectly in live environment.

### Live Test Results:
- ✅ ISO format: `2025-06-21T12:12:19Z`
- ✅ DateTime format: `2025-06-21 12:12:25`
- ✅ Timestamp format: `1750507947`
- ✅ Error handling: Invalid format defaults to ISO
